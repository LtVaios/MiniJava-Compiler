# MiniJava Compiler
✔️ For this project I made my own compiler for a language called MiniJava which is a subset of Java. More details about what is permitted in MiniJava are written below. In the file minijava.html you wil find minijava's grammar.

## About MiniJava

## Installation / Run
🔹 Download the compiler and the examples and install them locally.
🔹 Move all the examples from the examples folder you want to run, inside thee 'src' folder.
🔹 Type in the terminal:
```
  $ make compile
```
🔹 Run with:
```
java Main [file1] [file2] ...
```
**[file1] [file2] etc. are the examples files you chose from the examples folder. The programm can run multiple examples at once. <br /><br />
